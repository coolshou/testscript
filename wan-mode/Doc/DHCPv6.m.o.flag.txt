Both M and O Flags are Set to 0. 
This combination corresponds to a network without a DHCPv6 infrastructure. 
Hosts use router advertisements for non-link-local addresses and 
other methods (such as manual configuration) to configure other settings.

Both M and O Flags are Set to 1. 
DHCPv6 is used for both addresses and other configuration settings. 
This combination is known as DHCPv6 stateful, in which DHCPv6 is assigning stateful addresses to IPv6 hosts.

The M Flag is Set to 0 and the O Flag is Set to 1. 
DHCPv6 is not used to assign addresses, only to assign other configuration settings. 
Neighboring routers are configured to advertise non-link-local address prefixes from which IPv6 hosts derive stateless addresses. 
This combination is known as DHCPv6 stateless: DHCPv6 is not assigning stateful addresses to IPv6 hosts, but stateless configuration settings.

The M Flag is Set to 1 and the O Flag is Set to 0. 
In this combination, DHCPv6 is used for address configuration but not for other settings. 
Because IPv6 hosts typically need to be configured with other settings, 
such as the IPv6 addresses of Domain Name System (DNS) servers, this is an unlikely combination.
